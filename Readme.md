# Wireless Blinky Board

This is a simple project to demonstrate some of the webserver capabilities on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah32. I use a 8x8 monochrome SPI display for output in this project.

This project is mostly for experimentation and I don't plan to fully document it. I do plan to make a separate documented project based on this one in the future.
